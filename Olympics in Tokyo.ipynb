    "The Olympics is a major international sporting event that takes place every four years, bringing together athletes from around the world to compete in various sports. The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games held in ancient Greece from the 8th century BCE to the 4th century CE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modern Olympics were first held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, and have since become the most prestigious and widely watched sporting event globally. The Games consist of two main editions: the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, each held every four years but staggered, so there is an Olympic Games event every two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of the Olympics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Participation: Athletes from different countries compete in the Games, fostering camaraderie, friendship, and understanding among nations.\n",
    "Sports: A wide range of sports are featured in the Olympics, including athletics, swimming, gymnastics, soccer, basketball, skiing, ice hockey, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Host Cities: The Games are hosted by different cities around the world, selected through a competitive bidding process overseen by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Olympic Symbols: The Olympic Rings (five interlocking rings representing the continents) and the Olympic Flame (symbolizing the continuity between ancient and modern Games) are iconic symbols of the Olympics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Olympic Values: The Games are guided by core principles, including excellence, friendship, respect, and fair play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ceremonies: The opening and closing ceremonies are grand spectacles that showcase the host country's culture and history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legacy: Hosting the Olympics often leaves a lasting legacy of improved infrastructure, sports facilities, and urban development in the host city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Olympics have faced challenges and controversies throughout their history, such as boycotts, doping scandals, and financial concerns. Nevertheless, they continue to captivate the world and inspire athletes to achieve their best on the global stage. The Olympics remain a celebration of human athleticism, international cooperation, and the pursuit of sporting excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the year 2020, Olympics had to happen in the Tokyo city of Japan but due to Covid-19 pandemic they got postponed to the year 2021. Here is an exploratory data analysis for the same olympics games held in the city of Tokyo in 2021."
